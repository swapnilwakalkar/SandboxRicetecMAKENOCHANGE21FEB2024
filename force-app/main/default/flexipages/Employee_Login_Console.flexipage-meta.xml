Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled, on time and prepared to start working. Employees also are expected to remain at work for their entire work schedule. Late arrival, early departure or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This policy does not apply to absences covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These exceptions are described in separate policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Absence&quot; is defined as the failure of an employee to report for work when he or she is scheduled to work.&amp;nbsp;The two types of absences are defined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excused absence&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;occurs when all the following conditions are met:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The employee provides to his or her supervisor sufficient notice at least 48 hours in advance of the absence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The absence request is approved in advance by the employee&apos;s supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The employee has sufficient accrued paid time off (PTO) to cover the absence.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unexcused absence&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;occurs when any of the above conditions are not met. If it is necessary for an employee to be absent or late for work because of an illness or an emergency, the employee must notify his or her supervisor no later than the employee&apos;s scheduled starting time on that same day. If the employee is unable to call, he or she must have someone make the call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexcused absence counts as one occurrence for the purposes of discipline under this policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees with three or more consecutive days of excused absences&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;because of illness or injury&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;must give [Company Name] proof of physician&apos;s care and a fitness for duty release prior to returning to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees must take earned PTO for every absence unless otherwise allowed by company policy (e.g., leave of absence, bereavement, jury duty).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tardiness and Early Departures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees are expected to report to work and return from scheduled breaks on time. If employees cannot report to work as scheduled, they must notify their supervisor no later than their regular starting time. This notification does not excuse the tardiness but simply notifies the supervisor that a schedule change may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees who must leave work before the end of their scheduled shift must notify a supervisor immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tardiness and early departures are each one-half an occurrence for the purpose of discipline under this policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disciplinary Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive absenteeism is defined as two or more occurrences of unexcused absence in a 30-day period and will result in disciplinary action. Eight occurrences of unexcused absence in a 12-month period are considered grounds for termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any employee who fails to report to work for a period of three days or more without notifying his or her supervisor will be considered to have abandoned the job and voluntarily terminated the employment relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</value>
